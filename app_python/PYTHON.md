# Python App

## Python Best Practices

- Using Version Control
- Following Style Guidelines (PEP8)
- Using Virtual Environments
  - However, the `venv` folder is ignored.
- Writing readable documentation.

## Framework

Flask is one of the most popular web micro-frameworks for Python. It requires minimum boilerplate code yet provides rich feature set.

## Unit Tests

The tests are located in the `test.py` file. They cover the logic of the Flask app. That is:

- setting the correct timezone;
- proper timezone formatting.

### Unit Testing Best Practices

- A test case should only focus on one small part of functionality
- Tests should be independent from each other.
- Tests should run fast.
- Use long and descriptive names for test cases.
